# TryHackMe: Cybersecurity 101 Path - My Learnings & Takeaways

---

## Overview

This repository serves as a summary of my key learnings and practical takeaways from completing the **TryHackMe (THM) "Cybersecurity 101" path**. This foundational path was my first dedicated step into the cybersecurity domain, providing me with essential basic knowledge and hands-on exposure.

While I've gained a solid initial understanding, I recognize the need to develop a deeper and more robust comprehension of these concepts as I continue my journey.

## What I Learned & Took Away

The "Cybersecurity 101" path provided a broad introduction to various facets of cybersecurity. Here's what I specifically learned and gained a feel for:

* **Core Cybersecurity Concepts:** I now understand fundamental principles like the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability), common threat types, and the importance of security awareness.
* **Networking & OS Basics:** I grasped the basics of how networks function (TCP/IP, common protocols) and gained familiarity with navigating and interacting with both Windows and Linux operating systems via the command line.
* **Basic Attack Vectors & Offensive Tooling:**
    * I've learned about **basic attack vectors** that adversaries commonly use.
    * I've gained a practical understanding of what to look for and how to approach exploitation using **Metasploit**. This includes understanding its framework and how to utilize basic modules.
    * I've also gotten a feel for **basic attack tools like Hydra** for brute-forcing credentials.
    * *My current understanding is foundational, and I'm eager to deepen my knowledge in advanced exploitation techniques.*
* **Introduction to IT Forensics:** I've gained a **feeling for basic IT forensics**, understanding the initial steps involved in incident response and digital evidence collection. This has provided a valuable perspective from the defensive side.
* **Exposure to Defensive Tooling:** I've had an initial look at **defensive tooling like Flare-VM**, which provided insight into malware analysis environments. This complements my offensive interests by showing the broader security landscape.

## What's Next?

Having established this foundational understanding with "Cybersecurity 101," I am now incredibly excited to continue my journey and dive deeper into practical offensive security by actively working through the **TryHackMe Junior Penetration Tester path**. This next phase will allow me to build upon these basics, refine my skills, and explore more advanced techniques in a structured manner.
